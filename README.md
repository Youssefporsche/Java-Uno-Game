# Java-Uno-Game
Uno is a popular well known card game that is played by families and friends all around the world. I have finished this project in a duration of 1-month,
As I started at the beginning of september 2022 and finished the project by the end of that month.
# Intro  
The game mainly revolves around each player being able to draw a specific number of cards
at the start of the game, and the objective is for each player to finish the cards that they are
holding in their hands. Whenever a player manages to discard or play all the cards in their
hand, they are declared the winner.

# Deck and Cards
In our implementation of Uno, we will be using a deck of cards that consists of 100 cards. The
deck is split into 2 types of Cards: Wild cards, and Color Cards. The Color cards are further
classified into 2 different types of cards: Number cards, and Action Cards.
The deck consists of 4 different colors (Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow), each color contains 23
cards; 4 Action cards and 19 Number cards. The action cards available are either Hit cards or
Skip cards. While the number cards carry the numbers from 0 to 9. Each color has 2 Hit cards,
2 Skip cards, 1 number “0” card, and 2 cards of each other number from 1 to 9.
In addition the deck contains 8 wild cards, and wild cards are not considered as belonging to any color.

#  Once the game starts , Initially , Every player should have 7-cards in his hands.
